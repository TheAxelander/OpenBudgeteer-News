                OpenBudgeteer 1.6 is now available with new features, optimizations and some fixes. Check out the Changelog for the full list of changes. Below some highlights of the new update:

            <h5>Recurring Transactions & Split</h5>
            <p align="center">

                It's now possible to manually split a Bank Transaction into multiple Buckets. In addition, if the amount assigned to a Bucket is lower than the Transaction itself, the remaining amount is displayed. Thanks a lot to <a href="https://github.com/ambroser1971">Rich Ambrose</a> for implementing this feature.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Creation of Recurring Transactions has been added too. This is useful if you mainly add your Bank Transactions manually instead of importing txt/csv files.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Import page got some slight redesign. You can now switch between all steps in an accordion view, where each section is enabled depending on your input.
            </p>
            <h5>News Feed</h5>
            <p class="card-text">

                All planned features for the upcoming 1.6 Update are now available on <strong>pre-release</strong>. Before releasing the update I do my regular checks to see if there are still some bugs popping up. 
                Of course in case some new bugs are reported after release I try to resolve them on short notice.
